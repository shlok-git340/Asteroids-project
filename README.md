ASTEROIDS is a classic shooter game in which you are a triangular spaceship tackling circular asteroids coming in your way
Goal is to save yourself from colliding while simultaeneously eliminating the asteroids 
Use the standard WASD keys to move and SPACE to shoot
I have cloned the asteroids game to get an understanding about the basics of game development as well as Object Oriented Programming in Python
